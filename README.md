# Advent Of Code 2023

I've never done AoC before. ⭐️

I'm doing it in Go in order to learn Go!

## Day 5 Update: 🦀

### Pivot to Rust 🦀

I decided to try this one in Rust 🦀

I spent so long on learning string parsing that I got frustrated and brute forced the solution for Part 2. I parallelized it and got it to run in 15 min 36 seconds on my Mac. Not ideal! But I have enjoyed gaining some fluency in Rust.

## Day 6

Ok these are getting tough! Still using Rust 🦀

I probably could have brute forced this one and done it a lot faster but I knew there was a way to do it with quadratic equations, it just took a long time to figure out what that was.
