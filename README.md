# Advent Of Code 2023

I've never done AoC before. ‚≠êÔ∏è

I'm doing it in Go in order to learn Go!

## Day 5 Update: ü¶Ä

### Pivot to Rust ü¶Ä

I decided to try this one in Rust ü¶Ä

I spent so long on learning string parsing that I got frustrated and brute forced the solution for Part 2. I parallelized it and got it to run in 15 min 36 seconds on my Mac. Not ideal! But I have enjoyed gaining some fluency in Rust.

## Day 6

Ok these are getting tough! Still using Rust ü¶Ä

I probably could have brute forced this one and done it a lot faster but I knew there was a way to do it with quadratic equations, it just took a long time to figure out what that was.

NGL I'm using ChatGPT for a lot of things - to remind me what the quadratic equation looks like, to help me implement it in Rust (new language for me!). But I'm making sure to grok what it's giving me and it's not like it's spitting out the correct answer on the first try anyway. I'm not _not_ telling it "here is the problem, solve it for me." I am using it to help me learn the language and help me do some math in it. It still took a long time but hey - the quadratics were my idea and my code solves it in 1 microsecond. Tough to beat that.

Ok I needed to get that off my chest.
