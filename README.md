# Advent Of Code 2023

I've never done AoC before. ⭐️

I'm doing it in Go in order to learn Go!

## Day 5 Update: 🦀

### Pivot to Rust 🦀

I decided to try this one in Rust 🦀

I spent so long on learning string parsing that I got frustrated and brute forced the solution for Part 2. I parallelized it and got it to run in 15 min 36 seconds on my Mac. Not ideal! But I have enjoyed gaining some fluency in Rust.

## Day 6

Ok these are getting tough! Still using Rust 🦀

I probably could have brute forced this one and done it a lot faster but I knew there was a way to do it with quadratic equations, it just took a long time to figure out what that was.

## Day 7

Sticking with Rust 🦀. In general, the most time consuming thing is fighting with the borrow checker. I could do these a lot faster in Go (or JS or Python or PHP...).

This was a fun one to do in Rust though! Learned a ton about Enums and sorting. Part 2 wasn't a great leap at all from my Part 1 code. I just had to set the value of J to 0 and add a bunch of futzy conditional logic to determine the hand type. I am sure there are more elegant ways to accomplish that but I'm ok with this.
